# OS X 10.4 Emu

🖥️ A lovingly crafted Swift-based emulator front-end that mimics the classic **Mac OS X 10.4 "Tiger"** login experience — complete with Aqua UI, brushed metal textures, startup chime, and vintage realism.

> **Note**: This is not a full emulator or virtualization engine, but a user interface recreation designed to run in SwiftUI. It's great for aesthetic experiences, UI demos, or educational interfaces.
